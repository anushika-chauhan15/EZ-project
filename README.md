# AI-Assisted PDF Reader

An AI-powered tool designed to read, process, and extract text from PDF documents. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the content of PDFs and provide useful insights or summaries.

## Features

* Extracts text content from PDF files.
* Provides summarization of long documents.
* Supports search functionality to find specific content.
* Allows you to ask questions about the document using AI.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.x
* Pip (Python package manager)

### Steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-assisted-pdf-reader.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ai-assisted-pdf-reader
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the tool to process PDF files through a Python script or command line interface.

### Running the Script

To process a PDF file, simply run the script:

```bash
python pdf_reader.py path_to_your_pdf.pdf
```

This will extract the text from the PDF and print it to the console.

### Summarizing a PDF

To summarize a PDF document, use the summarization function:

```bash
python pdf_reader.py --summarize path_to_your_pdf.pdf
```

### Asking Questions about the PDF

You can ask questions regarding the content of the PDF file:

```bash
python pdf_reader.py --ask "What is the main topic of this document?" path_to_your_pdf.pdf
```

### Searching for Keywords

To search for specific keywords within the PDF, use the `--search` option:

```bash
python pdf_reader.py --search "artificial intelligence" path_to_your_pdf.pdf
```

## How It Works

### PDF Text Extraction

* The tool uses the **PyMuPDF** library to extract text from PDF files. This allows for accurate retrieval of text, images, and tables.

### AI Analysis

* After extracting the text, the document is processed with **transformer-based models** (like GPT or BERT) to answer questions, provide summaries, and extract meaningful content.

### NLP Tasks

* **Summarization**: Using AI to generate a concise summary of the PDF's content.
* **Question Answering**: Users can ask questions based on the content, and the AI will extract the most relevant answers.
* **Keyword Search**: The tool can scan through the text to find occurrences of keywords.
